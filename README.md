## 🛠️ Building Philosophy

- Build something useful and make money selling it
- Get products in customers' hands ASAP and iterate — time spent building in isolation should be minimal
- Rapid feedback cycles over perfect launches
- Product first
- Agent orchestration + parallelisation (grouping tasks and review steps together as much as possible) + verifiability
